Project Wrltzr
==============

This is (for now) just a proof-of-concept of a would-be smart radio which merges search results from all the major music streaming services, leveraging Youtube videos for cases when the stream isn't directly available.

It's under heavy development, so don't expect anything to be working. Insteads, contributions, bug reports and feature suggestions are extremely welcome.
